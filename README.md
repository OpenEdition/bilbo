### Bilbo

BILBO is an open source software for automatic annotation of bibliographic reference.

It provides the segmentation and tagging of input string. It is principally based on
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), machine learning technique to segment and label
sequence data.

As external softwares, Wapiti is used for CRF learning and inference (https://wapiti.limsi.fr)
and SVMlight is used for sequence classification.
