These examples demonstrate the Python SAX API, version 1. In all examples,
the sax driver can be specified by setting the PY_SAX_PARSER environment
variable. Valid settings are 
- xml.sax.drivers.drv_pyexpat
- xml.sax.drivers.drw_xmlproc
- xml.sax.drivers.drv_sgmlop
as well as any other driver listed in the xml/sax/drivers directory.

sax2obj.py     ???
saxdemo.py     Parses an XML file, and prints it in canonical form.
               Invoke as 'python saxdemo.py filename.xml'.
               The standard driver will be pyexpat. 
               Alternative drivers can be specified with the -d option 
               of saxdemo.py; the prefix 'xml.sax.drivers.drv_' is 
               automatically added to the driver.
saxhack.py     appears to be broken
saxstats.py    Prints statistics about an xml file.
saxtimer.py    Times parsing a document; arguments are the parser name
               (the prefix 'xml.sax.drivers.drv_' is automatically added)
               and the document name.
saxtrace.py    parses a document using xmlproc, and prints all SAX events.
