================== 
Version 0.8.4 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from the
following URLs:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.4.tar.gz
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.2.exe
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.3.exe
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.3.exe

Changes in this version, compared to 0.8.3:

  * bump version number to 0.8.4, as Python 2.4 requires that
    as the minimum PyXML version.
  * Expat 1.95.8 is provided; pyexpat is extended to expose more
    expat features:
    - CurrentLineNumber, CurrentColumnNumber, CurrentByteIndex
    - symbolic error numbers added in Expat 1.95.7 and 1.95.8
  * Added Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) namespaces to the
    xml.ns module.
  * fix memory leaks in pyexpat
  * fix line number reporting in SAX

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.

The package currently contains:

        * XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
          Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).
        * SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
        * minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod, others)
        * 4DOM and 4XPath from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
        * Schema implementations: TREX (James Tauber)
        * Various utility modules and functions (various people)
        * Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments and
questions to <xml-sig@python.org>.  Bug reports may be filed on
SourceForge:
