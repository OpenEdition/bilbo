4DOM

Description
===========

4DOM is a Python-based implementation of the W3C-recommended
Document Object Model API.  Specifically, 4DOM implements

  * DOM Level 2 Core Version 1.0 (13 November 2000 Recommendation),
  * DOM HTML Level 2 (13 November 2000 Working Draft), and
  * DOM Level 2 Traversal (13 November 2000 Recommendation)

4DOM should work on all platforms supported by Python.


Installation
============

4DOM is built and installed with PyXML's other libraries when you run
setup.py.  It cannot be installed separately.


License/Copyright
=================

For now, 4DOM retains its license and copyright that it had when
developed by Fourthought, Inc. <http://fourthought.com/>.  See the
LICENCE file in the PyXML distribution and/or the COPYRIGHT file in
the xml/dom subdirectory for complete copyright and terms of license.


Documentation
=============

Python's generic DOM API, as shared by both 4DOM and minidom, is
documented at

  http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.dom.html

The DOM APIs that are implemented in 4DOM are specified at

  http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/
  http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/
  http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/

Development
===========

4DOM is open-source and is maintained by the PyXML development
community.  Most of 4DOM's original development was undertaken by
Fourthought, Inc., from 1998-2000.  4DOM was incorporated into PyXML
starting with the PyXML 0.6.0 release in September 2000, and was
distributed in both PyXML and 4Suite for a time.  It ceased being
distributed in 4Suite starting with the PyXML 0.6.4 release in
February 2001, at which time maintenance was handed over entirely to
the PyXML team.  Most development since then has concentrated on bug
fixes and compatibility issues.
