Changes in 0.10.2 (R20000724)
-----------------------------

 - Support wide range of output encodings via wstring
 - Updated conformance to 20000510 DOM CR
 - Changed internals to use Node as the clone manager, using a pickle-
   style interface.
 - Changed many classes to be generated in the HTML Extension
 - Other bug-fixes

Changes in 0.10.1 (R20000606)
-----------------------------

 - Fix nasty character-encoding bugs in Printer
 - Fixed many bugs in demos
 - Fix Sax2 support for passed-in documents
 - Other bug-fixes

Changes in 0.10.0 (R20000524)
-----------------------------

 - Moved all static variables to class variables
 - Fixed printing to work with empty elements
 - Removed all tabs from files
 - Change package to xml.dom
 - major change to the internals to use Node as a Python attribute manager
   this improves efficiency: cutting down on __g/setattrs__ and simplifies
   some things
 - Updated conformance to 19991210 DOM CR (yes, already out of date.  Zut!)
 - Many fixes to HTML output
 - Support custom Documents in Sax2 reader
 - Many other fixes to printing and reading

Changes in 0.9.3 (R20000216)
----------------------------

 - Better UTF-8 handling in printing
 - Clean up printer whitespace
 - Fix nasty bug in Sax2 attribute namespace defaulting
 - Other bug-fixes

Changes in 0.9.2 (R20000125)
----------------------------

 - Major fixes to namespace code
 - Other bug-fixes

Changes in 0.9.1 (R20000103)
----------------------------

 - Fixed HTML reader
 - Misc. Bug-Fixes

Note: There were numerous changes in untagged release 0.9.0,
including

 - Major re-write to match the general consensus DOm binding for
  Python.  Code formerly in the form "node.getChildNodes()"
  is now to be used in the form "node._get_childNodes()" or
  simply "node.childNodes".  Similarly "text.setData("spam")"
  becomes "text._set_data("spam")" or text.data = "spam"

 - Update to full Level 2 support in core and HTML, including
  namespace-support.

 - Many bug-fixes

Changes in 0.8.2 (R19991019)
----------------------------

- Create a Reader module under Ext for importing strings into 4DOM.
  Builder is now deprecated and will disappear before version 1.0
	o Reader has three drivers currently: Sax and HtmlLib are
	  just modularized versions of the functionality that was
          formerly in Builder, and Sax2 is a driver for the
	  as-yet experimental SAX 2 specification.
- Fixed a Builder/Reader bug for HTML input and empty, unclosed tags
  such as <br>
- Fixed a bug in text normalization
- Miscellaneous bug-fixes

Changes in 0.8.1 (R19990914)
----------------------------

- Added support for Dom Level 2 Core interfaces
- Added __repr__ to all Core interfaces
- Output character entities where appropriate in Printer.py
- Many bug-fixes to Printer.py
- Bug-fixes to attribute
- Modified Remote factory startup to use environment variables
	
Changes in 0.8.0 (R19990831)
----------------------------

- Major Changes to the organization and Module Namespace
	o Top-level namespace is Ft.Dom to integrate with other
	  FourThought Packages
	o Naming of Packages, Classes, Modules etc. has been normalized to
	  "camel-case" with abbreviations counted as word units, e.g.
	  XMLFooBarHTML -> XmlFooBarHtml
	  This normalization is not possible where W3C clashes, e.g.
	  HTMLElement remains as is.
	o Simplified the access of Node constants, e.g. you can use
	  Ft.Dom.Node.ELEMENT_NODE rather than Ft.Dom.Dom.Node.ELEMENT_NODE
- Added extensions to support XML Namespaces (Ext.Namespace)
- Added UserList and UserDict interface to NodeList and NamedNodeMap,
  allowing orbless or local code to use pythonic features such as
  [], append(), len(), keys(), etc.
- Added better ILU Support
- Added support for xml:space and turned Ext.Strip into separate functions
  for stripping HTML and XML.
- Fixed a problem with importing mis-matched HTML tags.
- Numerous minor bug fixes
	

Changes in 0.7.2 (R19990422)
----------------------------

- "orbless" is now the default target of the Makefile, so most users
  can just type "make" once installed

- DListElement had been left out of the orbless configuration: fixed

- Removed the kludge for dynamic addition of tedious HTML Eement attributes

Changes in 0.7.1
-------------------------------

- Fixed "make orbless" to instruct the user what to add to PythonPath.

- Fixed bug in HTMLTable.getRows, and HTMLTableSection.getRows.
  Before a call to these functions was using getElementsByTagName
  to return a list of TR elements.  This breaks when a table has
  a table in one of it cells.

- Fixed index error in HTMLTable.insertRow

- Removed evals from PrettyPrinter

- Fixed index error in HTMLTableRow.insertCell

- Removed call to extension functions in PrettyPrinter

- Added XCatalog support, if available, to Builder.FromXML

- Changed SAX Handler class for Builder.FromXML to a parameter,
  to allow input filters, etc.

- Changed Builder.FromXML to add the read-in tree to the created
  document, if one is not given.  If one is given, just return a
  fragment, as in version 0.7.0.

- Added utility APIs to DOM.Ext.Builder:
    o FromXMLStream
    o FromXMLFile
    o FromXMLURL
    o FromHTMLFile
    o FromHTMLStream
    o FromHTMLURL

- Reduced the PrettyPrint indentation from a tab to two spaces.

Changes in 0.7.0 (R19990207)
----------------------------

- Added support for "orbless" configuration.  Now neither ILU nor Fnorb
  are requred and 4DOM can be run purely locally, but still with a
  consistent interface.  Naturally, the orbless config is much
  faster than the ilu or fnorb configs.

- Many fixes to improve consistency over an ORB interface
  (an example using an ORB has been added to demos).

- Fixes to NodeList and NamedNodeMap

- Added an Ext package for DOM extensions, and moved many of the
  existing extensions there.  See docs/Extensions.html.
	
- Added to Ext an extensive factory interface for creation of nodes,
  consistent for local and ORB use.

- Added to Ext a ReleaseNode helper function to reclaim unused nodes,
  necessary for ORB usage, and also for local usage because of
  circular references.

- Added NodeIterators and Node Filters from DOM Level 2
	
- Added a visitor and walker system (to Ext).  These generalize the
  NodeIterator concept for cases where pre-order traversal is not
  suitable: for instance printing.

- Removed the repr functions from Node interfaces in favor of print
  walker/visitors.

- Added Print and PrettyPrint helper functions to Ext for printing
  and pretty-printing node trees.

- Added Strip helper function to Ext to strip all ignorable
  white-space text nodes from a node tree.

- Moved all tools to construct a DOM tree from XML and HTML text to
  a Builder module in Ext, with two functions: FromXML and FromHTML.

- Added options to FromXML that allow specification of whether to keep
  ignorable whitespce int he resultant node tree, and options on
  whether to validate.
	
- Innumerable minor and miscellaneous fixes
	
Changes in 0.6.1 (R19981120)
----------------------------

- added ILU support with a series of kludges
  (all designed to minimize effect on existing DOM code):

	o Use ILU's python-stubber in makefile rather than fnidl
	o python-stubber generates *IF__skel rather than fnidl's
	  *IF_skel, so copy the files so bother names are available.
	o add config modules for DOM core and HTML, globally imported,
	  which creates dummy INTERFACENAME_skel classes because ILU
	  does not append "_skel" to skeleton class names as Fnorb
	  does: it uses module-scoping for the distinction.
	o Add variables using Fnorb-style constant naming
	  (INTERFACENAME.CONSTANTNAME) to refer to the ILU-style
	  constants (INTERFACENAME_CONSTANTNAME)
	o Brutally hack all 4DOM source files during make to change
	  Fnorb-style invocations for DOMException
	  (raise DOMException(EXCEPTNAME))
	  into ILU-style
	  (raise DOMException, DOMException__omgidl_exctype(EXCEPTNAME))

  note that this series of kludges slows things down and adds some
  bloat, but we plan to intelligently convert to better-considered
  fixes in time.  Also, there will be some degree of resolution between
  Fnorb and ILU as the Python-CORBA mapping gets adopted, so let's
  avoid baking any fixes prematurely into the code.

- added the #pragma prefix "fourthought.com" to all IDL files
- Document.repr() now includes the DOCTYPE

Version: 0.6.0 (R19981104)
--------------------------

- initial public release
